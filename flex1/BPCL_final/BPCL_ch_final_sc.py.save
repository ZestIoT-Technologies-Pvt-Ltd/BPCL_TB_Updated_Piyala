Input: The model takes input from two cameras, one camera is used to find whether the cylinder bed is moving or not and the other one is used to find person attentiveness
Output: The model sends the alarm values to the timer function based on person attentiveness
Requirements:
This function shall perform the following:
1)This function calls the track method passing the input feed of camera located over the cylinder bed, the track function returns whether the cylinder bed is moving or not.
2)If the cylinder bed is moving, the input feed of camera contains the person who needs to look after the cylinders is sent to posenet model.
3)From posenet model the person pose is estimated and the person landmark coordinates and their respective scores are returned.
4)The roi_fun returns the coordinates of persons who are in ROI,those coordinates are sent to view_detection and the method returns the coordinates of persons who are viewing in required direction.
5)The view_angle method plots the conical shape stating which side they were looking and the coordinates are passed to motion function which return whether the person whos is in ROI and viewing in required direction is in motion or not.
6)Based on the output of the ROI,view,motion methods the respective flags are sent to timer function.
7)The Diagnostics methods finds the devices are in proper working condition or not.
